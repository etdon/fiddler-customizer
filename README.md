## ðŸ”° Introduction

The `fiddler-customization` project is a proof-of-concept tool to apply a dark mode look to the [Fiddler Classic](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddler-classic) UI which doesn't support it by default and is using
various, deprecated, WinForm controls making customization tedious. The tool works by leveraging mostly un-documented Windows API for drawing/flagging as well as C++/CLI to interact with the CIL components of the application
during run-time since Fiddler Classic is written in C#.

As mentioned this is mainly a proof-of-concept and the project is not finished. Some deprecated controls will still have white borders, dark mode rendering might not apply to all windows and pages and the visibility of some
controls might not be optimal. It's also a proof-of-concept because none of the used techniques fully depend on the Fiddler Classic implementation, with rather small adjustments the same effect can be achieved for other
WinForm applications.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requirements:
> - Any DLL Injector
>   - Recommended: [loadlib-dll-injector](https://github.com/etdon/loadlib-dll-injector)

If want to download a pre-compiled executable you can find all releases paired with their checksums here: [Releases](https://github.com/etdon/fiddler-customizer/releases)

In order to inject the DLL into Fiddler Classic using the recommended DLL injector you can use the following command:
```
dll-injector.exe "Fiddler.exe" <DLL path>
```
